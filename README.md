# Blockchain-based-Smart-Contract-Digitized-Lottery-Scheme:

Lottery games are different from other gambling games because these games doesn’t depend upon the skill of the player but is completely depended upon the luckiness. There is an urgent need for replacement of traditional system by a totally computerised system that ensure fairness,transparency and the fair distribution of funds, which all are the most common problems that most people surmise, distrust, and complain about .And due to these facts we bestrew Blockchain with the process of purchasing and selling of lotteries. We use blockchain technology in evaluating payment, ticketing and payouts in distribution environments.Blockchain network allows equal participation of each player. There is no central power concept instead power is distributed among all participants.

# Blockchain
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. It is an imperishable digital ledger of economic transaction. In blockchain it allows to record not only financial transactions but virtually everything of value. It is a structure consisting of blocks that stores transactional records, of several heterogeous records in several databases, which is known as the “chain,” in a network connected through compeer-to-compeer nodes. Generally, this storage is referred to as a 'digital ledger’. This allows digital information to be rationed, but not transcribed. That means each individual piece of data can only have one owner and also the deed of associating blocks into a chain makes the information stored on blockchain trustworthy.


# Ethereum
Ethereum was launched in 2015. Ethereum is an open source, prominent, public, distributed and blockchain-based computing platform highlighting smart contract functionality. The Ethereum is currently the most appropriate one to build decentralized applications. Ethereum is a blockchain based open source pulpit which is capable of providing developers the ability to build and set-up a decentralized application. Ethereum is a platform betrothed to grant people to conveniently write decentralized applications using blockchain technology. In Ethereum blockchain, prospector endeavour to earn Ether,which is a type of crypto token which fuels the network. Ethereum is a pulpit for sharing information across the globe that cannot be wielded or altered. Ether also known as ETH is a decentralized digital currency.


# Smart Contract
In simple words Smart Contracts are small computer programs that “live” in the blockchain or runs on blockchain. The emanation of smart contract makes blockchain not only applicable to the financial fields, but also other fields, such as lottery. It is an agreement between two people in the form of computer code. Smart Contracts runs on blockchain, and hence stored on a public database and cannot be altered. The transactions that occur in a smart contract are handled by the blockchain, that is they can be sent automatically without a third party. Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform which spawns a crytocurrency token which is known as Ether. Smart contracts are executed automatically based on the code that the programmers program on Ethereum Blockchain. Ethereum Virtual Machine are used for running these contracts which is composed of all devices running on Ethereum nodes. The “decentralized platform” part means that anyone can set up and run an Ethereum node by paying the operators of those nodes in Ether, which is a cryptocurrency token tied to Ethereum. Thus, computing power is provided to the people who run Ether and are paid in Ether.


# Verifiable Random Function
A verifiable random function (VRF) is a spurious-random function.When we provide an input x to a VRF it produces a random number y along with a proof z for y. With the help of z, every participant can verify whether y was generated correctly from x or not. A VRF is the public-key version of the keyed-cryptographic hash. In VRF, only the one with the private key can compute the hash but anyone having the public key can verify its definiteness which is clear that it is unlike the the normal hash functions. A VRF also has to placate the following properties:
(1) Uniqueness: When an input x is given, there should be a unique y, such that the verification returns true.
(2) Provability : if x generates(y,z), then the verification returns true.
(3) Pseudo-Randomness: In case of a uniform distribution, the output y should be indistinguishble.

# System Goals
The goal of the system is to design a fair and an efficient lottery scheme, which ensures the
integrity and legitimacy of lottery result and is public to all the participants.
(1) Random Number Generation : Since the winning number is predicted randomly it is assured
for the accuracy of the result, since none of the players or the lottery centre can predict the value of
winning number .
(2) Public Verification : All stages in this system are put public so that all people could verify for
the fairness of the lottery.
(3) Efficiency : This system is a fully efficient one, which means the players can buy lottery
tickets adroitly and fairness of the lottery is verified rapidly.

# Security Analysis
1. Prediction Attack
This attack is related with the pecomputing and prediction of results by players or lottery centres.
If this can be done, then they can buy the ticket that is bound to win, which makes the lottery results
skeptical. All theses issues are efficiently solved with the use of Blockchain.
2. Bias Attack
Biasing the choice of winning number is another major attack done by lottery centre for
achieving their different goals which all causes a violation in the fairness of lottery. This can be done
by trying to pick up the winning number that no player has chosen or by picking up a winning
number that matches a ticket that a specific user bought.
3. Forging Attack
After the declaration of result, a player other than the winner or the lottery centre may try to forge
a winning ticket.
4. Impersonating Attack
After the winner is announced, sometimes there is a chance that another user may try to
impersonate and thus accept the award. But here, anyone cannot pretend to accept an award. Because
a player inititates a transaction on blockchain every time when executing a smart contract.
Blockchain comprises of a perfect signature mechanism, where every transaction includes
initiator’s signature, making it impossible for others to fake.
